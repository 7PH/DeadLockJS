# How to contribute to deadlock.js

- [Opening issues for bug reports or feature requests](#opening-issues)
- [Contributing code](#contributing-code)

## Opening issues

The preferred way to report bugs or request features is to use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/7PH/deadlockjs/issues).
Before opening an issue, read these pointers.

### Opening issues effectively

- Include information about **your operating system**.

- Mention which version of deadlock.js you're using. Preferably, try also with
  the current HEAD of the master branch, to ensure the problem has not already been
  fixed.

- Be precise:
  - Provide a quick summary and/or background
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
  - What you expected would happen
  - What actually happens
  - Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

- Be polite. Issues with an indignant or belligerent tone tend to be moved to the
  bottom of the pile.
